# Text-Rank-NLP
Using the Text Rank Algorithm for Extractive Text Summarisation.

The Text Rank Algorithm was inspired from the frevolutionary Page Rank Algorithm by Google.

We can use Text Rank for ranking or scoring the most significant or important sentences in a Text, and thus implement am Extractive Text Summarisation algorithm.

Here, the similarity is calculated by Cosine Similarity of Sentences, this can be improved by several other similarity algorithms as devised inthe original Text Rank.

This is an introductory/elementary implementation of the paper, who beginner NLP understanding.
